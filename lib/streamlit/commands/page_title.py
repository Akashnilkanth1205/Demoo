def set_page_title(title):
    """Set the page title.

    This title is shown on the browser tab, NOT in the app. Contrast with
    `st.title` which renders a title in-app but does not set the page title.

    Note: This is a beta feature. See
    https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/pre_release_features.html for more
    information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    title: str
        The text to set as the page title.

    Example
    -------
    >>> st.beta_set_page_title('Look up! ðŸ˜‰')
