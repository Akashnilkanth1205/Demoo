def set_favicon(
    image, clamp=False, channels="RGB", format="JPEG",
):
    """Set the page favicon to the specified image or emoji.

    This supports all the same parameters as `st.image` such as numpy arrays
    or URLs.

    You can also use an emoji as a favicon, either directly or with a shortcode [1].
    Emojis are rendered courtesy of Twemoji [2].

    Note: This is a beta feature. See
    https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/pre_release_features.html for more
    information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : numpy.ndarray, [numpy.ndarray], BytesIO, str, or [str]
        Monochrome image of shape (w,h) or (w,h,1)
        OR a color image of shape (w,h,3)
        OR an RGBA image of shape (w,h,4)
        OR a URL to fetch the image from
        OR an emoji like 'ðŸ¦ˆ'
        OR an emoji shortcode like ':shark:'
    clamp : bool
        Clamp image pixel values to a valid range ([0-255] per channel).
        This is only meaningful for byte array images; the parameter is
        ignored for image URLs. If this is not set, and an image has an
        out-of-range value, an error will be thrown.
    channels : 'RGB' or 'BGR'
        If image is an nd.array, this parameter denotes the format used to
        represent color information. Defaults to 'RGB', meaning
        `image[:, :, 0]` is the red channel, `image[:, :, 1]` is green, and
        `image[:, :, 2]` is blue. For images coming from libraries like
        OpenCV you should set this to 'BGR', instead.
    format : 'JPEG' or 'PNG'
        This parameter specifies the image format to use when transferring
        the image data. Defaults to 'JPEG'.

    Example
    -------
    >>> st.beta_set_favicon('https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/_static/logomark_website.png')
