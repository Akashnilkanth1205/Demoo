# Sanity checks

If you're having problems running your Streamlit app, here are a few things to try out.

## Check #1: Is Streamlit running?

On a Mac or Linux machine, type this on the terminal:

```bash
ps -Al | grep streamlit
```

If you don't see `streamlit run` in the output (or `streamlit hello`, if that's
the command you ran) then the Streamlit server is not running. So re-run your command and see if the bug goes away.

## Check #2: Is this an already-fixed Streamlit bug?

We try to fix bugs quickly, so many times a problem will go away when you
upgrade Streamlit. So the first thing to try when having an issue is upgrading
to the latest version of Streamlit:

```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit
streamlit version
```

...and then verify that the version number printed is `0.67.1`.

**Try reproducing the issue now.** If not fixed, keep reading on.

## Check #3: Are you running the correct Streamlit binary?

Let's check whether your Python environment is set up correctly. Edit the
Streamlit script where you're experiencing your issue, **comment everything
out, and add these lines instead:**

```python
import streamlit as st
st.write(st.__version__)
```

...then call `streamlit run` on your script and make sure it says the same
version as above. If not the same version, check out [these
instructions](clean-install.md) for some sure-fire ways to set up your
environment.

## Check #4: Is your browser caching your app too aggressively?

There are two easy ways to check this:

1. Load your app in a browser then press `Ctrl-Shift-R` or `âŒ˜-Shift-R` to do a
   hard refresh (Chrome/Firefox).

2. As a test, run Streamlit on another port. This way the browser starts the
   page with a brand new cache. For that, pass the `--server.port`
   argument to Streamlit on the command line:

   ```bash
   streamlit run my_app.py --server.port=9876
   ```

## Check #5: Is this a Streamlit regression?

If you've upgraded to the latest version of Streamlit and things aren't
working, you can downgrade at any time using this command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit==0.50
```

...where `0.50` is the version you'd like to downgrade to. See
[Changelog](../changelog.md) for a complete list of Streamlit versions.

## Check #6 [Windows]: Is Python added to your PATH?

When installed by downloading from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), Python is
not automatically added to the [Windows system PATH](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access). Because of this, you may get error messages
like the following:

Command Prompt:

```shell
C:\Users\streamlit> streamlit hello
'streamlit' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

PowerShell:

```shell
PS C:\Users\streamlit> streamlit hello
streamlit : The term 'streamlit' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that
the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ streamlit hello
+ ~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (streamlit:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
```

To resolve this issue, add [Python to the Windows system PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).

After adding Python to your Windows PATH, you should then be able to follow the instructions in our [Get Started](../getting_started.md#install-streamlit) section.
