"You should use a reverse proxy to forward requests from a webserver like "
"Apache or Nginx to the port where your Streamlit app is running. You can "
"accomplish this in several different ways. The simplest way is to forward"
" all requests sent to your domain so that your Streamlit app appears as "
"the content of your website."
msgstr ""

#: ../../streamlit_faq.md:17
msgid ""
"Another approach is to configure your webserver to forward requests to "
"designated subfolders (e.g. http://awesomestuff.net/streamlitapp) to "
"different Streamlit apps on the same domain, as in this example config "
"for Nginx submitted by a Streamlit community member."

"For example, let’s say you had two Streamlit apps called Calvin and "
"Hobbes. App Calvin is running on port 8501. You set up app Hobbes to run "
"on port 8502. Your webserver would then be set up to \"listen\" for "
"requests on subdomains calvin.somedomain.com and hobbes.subdomain.com, "

"There is a strict message protocol between Components and Streamlit, "
