# Welcome to Streamlit :wave:

**[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is the fastest way to build custom ML tools.**

All in Python. Free and open source.

![streamlit_uber_demo|635x380](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/streamlit/original/1X/292e985f7f75ef7bef8c27b5899f71f76cd577e0.gif)

Streamlit is an app framework for machine learning that allows you to rapidly create ML tools to visualize, explore, and compare your data and models. Quickly get the tools you need so you can spend more time on research and discovery and less on frontend development and infrastructure.

## Example

```python
import streamlit as st

# Strings appear in your app, with Markdown:
'''
# My first Streamlit app

Move the slider below and see what happens!
'''

# A simple app in 2 lines of code!
reps = st.slider('Repetitions', 1, 10)
st.write('Hello world. ' * reps)
```
