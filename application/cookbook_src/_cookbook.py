I will continuously update new component recipes here.
Visit from time to time, and look around different UI or AI elements.

## Publish Plan

I won't take much time for docs for a while, but focus on developing.
Please understand the minial documents.


## Multipages

Check the Nested Multipages example.

This structure is not possible with the current version of streamlit.
I am planning to make a pull request. If this idea is not accepted, I will consider publishing a patch package.

I will write more details in a post exclusively for this component.\
