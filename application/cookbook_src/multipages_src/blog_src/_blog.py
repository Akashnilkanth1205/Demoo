# Post Main

Write your main post for your blog here.

## Sorted Posts

Posts are sorted alphabetically.
To place the main page on the top, the name of the main page is .main_post.md. It will show the main page on the top regardless of its name.

## Code Optimization

Implementation codes are not optimized.
Therefore, I recommend you to just refer to the structure rather than to take all the design as they are.\
